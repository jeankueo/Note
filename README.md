## Words
Words | Explanation
--------- | --------
expressway | Autobahn
Autobahn | highspeed roads in Deutchland.
clearway  | a main road other than a motorway on which vehicles are not normally permitted to stop.
motorway | a dual-carriageway road designed for fast traffic, with relatively few places for joining or leaving.
driveway | private - a short road leading from a public road to a house or other building.
roadway | 
pavement | 
verge | 
carriageway | the part of a road intended for vehicles rather than pedestrians
footpath | a path for people to walk along, especially a right of way in the countryside. a path for pedestrians in a built-up area; a pavement.
differential lock | Known also as diff-lock or locker, it is a modification to the standard automotive differential. It’s purpose is to restrict each of the two wheels on an axle to the same rotational speed regardless of the traction available to each wheel.
power steering | helps drivers steer by augmenting steering effort of the steering wheel.
double parking | If someone double-parks their car or their car double-parks, they park in a road by the side of another parked car.
reversing lights | 倒车灯a white light at the rear of a vehicle that comes on when the vehicle is reversing. 
side lights | parking lights
parking lights | side lights 停车灯 Parking lights usuallz illuminate the vehicle very weekly and only on one side of the vehicle - the side towards the road.
hazard warning lights | 危险警告灯，即俩信号灯一起亮
caravan | 房车
catalytic converter | 催化转化器
kickdown | 强制降档 Kickdown is a downshift in an automatic transmission triggered when the driver pushes the accelerator to the floor. Automatic transmissions kick down to a lower gear to make use of the greater power delivered at the engine’s higher rpm; this typically occurs when the driver attempts to accelerate from a constant speed, as if to pass.
carpool | 拼车 Fahrgemeinschaften
power sound | indicates turning up the radio system in the vehicle to full
reverse lock | this set up makes it impossible to shift to reverse if the car is moving forward at more than a specific speed.
overrun brake | 超限制动An overrun brake (called a surge brake when invented) is a brake system commonly used on small trailers, where the motion of the trailer with respect to the towing vehicle is used to actuate the brake. When the trailer runs up to the truck, overrun brake is activated (detected by, for example, spring).
asphalt | 沥青
headrest | 靠头之物
brake fluid | 制动液 a type of hydraulic fluid used in hydraulic brake and hydraulic clutch applications in automobiles, motorcycles, light trucks, and some bicycles.
imperative | 迫切，势在必行
deterioration | 恶化
exhaust system | 排气系统 
main beam, driving beam, full beam, high beam, upper beam | 远光灯
dipped beam, low beam | 近光灯
jet | 喷嘴
reservoir | 池，库

ABS | Automatic Anti-locking Device 自动防锁装置 (ABS) is an automobile safety system that allows the wheels on a motor vehicle to maintain tractive contact with the road surface according to driver inputs while braking, preventing the wheels from locking up (ceasing rotation) and avoiding uncontrolled skidding.
aquaplaning | 滑水
tip over | overturn 翻倒
wobble | 摇摇晃晃
spoiler  | 扰流板 A spoiler is an automotive aerodynamic device whose intended design function is to 'spoil' unfavorable air movement across a body of a vehicle in motion, usually described as turbulence or drag. Spoilers on the front of a vehicle are often called air dams. Spoilers are often fitted to race and high-performance sports cars, although they have become common on passenger vehicles as well. Some spoilers are added to cars primarily for styling purposes and have either little aerodynamic benefit or even make the aerodynamics worse.
The term "spoiler" is often mistakenly used interchangeably with "wing". An automotive wing is a device whose intended design is to generate downforce as air passes around it, not simply disrupt existing airflow patterns.[1][2] As such, rather than decreasing drag, automotive wings actually increase drag.
merging lane | acceleration lane | interweaving lane
restrain | 抑制
retain | 保留
tailgating | 随行
counter steering | 反转向 used by single-track vehicle operators, such as cyclists and motorcyclists, to initiate a turn toward a given direction by momentarily steering counter to the desired direction ("steer left to turn right"). To negotiate a turn successfully, the combined center of mass of the rider and the single-track vehicle must first be leaned in the direction of the turn, and steering briefly in the opposite direction causes that lean.[1] The rider's action of countersteering is sometimes referred to as "giving a steering command".
